              ename=101
Java
{
Strictly typed and static type programming language
Java is based on Compiler typed programming language
[int eid=10;
string ename="Rahul";
double esalary=45000;
boolean avail=true;]
}
Javascript
{
Loosely Typed
Javascript is based on Interpretetor typed programming language
It is used to declare the variable using ("var")
[var eid=101;
var name="Rahul";
var esalary=45000
var avail=true;]
}

Python
{
Dynamic Typed Programming Language

[eid=101
ename="Rahul"
esalary=45000
avail=True
eid="Rahul Gandhi"]
}

g)Extensive library.
